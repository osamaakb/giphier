// The base model will serve as an interface for bth gif and sticker models. Since we want
// our app to be as abstract as possible without actually knowing what is it dealing with
// In the grid and modal, we will assume we get a base model and use its getters to access data without
// knowing what they really are. Merely items.
// This requires as to remap the different data shapes for stickers and gifs to fall into this model as required
// using thier models constructor
// That is in case we are using different apis
